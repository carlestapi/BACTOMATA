# BACTOMATA ___////

.- An ***heterotic hybrid computing device*** based on a coevolving system composed of (*in vivo*) bacterial plasmid populations and (*in silico*) elementary cellular automata (ECA) rules that update the physical state of the bacterial growth environment. 

.- The system acts as an autonomous unsupervised installation with the capacity of generating a responsive dialog between an evolving primordial open-ended biological entity and a simple algorithmic rule whose computational complexity is Turing complete. 

.- The device is physically actuated by a micro-pipetting robot that performs serial transfers of bacterial populations in discrete intervals and also inoculates its growth substrate in 96-well plates. The sensory feedback layer of the system is based on an open microscope working on a RaspPi that measures bacterial optical density at each time-step and performs an update in the ECA rule according to a responsive machine learning system. 

.- This cross-domain association involves the combination of two computational substrates in one computational system whose output cannot be expressed as the sum of its individual components.  In addition, this dual propagation in time of entangled bacterial-bit states may be framed as an instantiation of a novel communication modality allying two primordial intelligences without an explicit anthropocentric interference.

## Augmented work

- Solar Protocol Call: 

It seems natural to decouple the system energy/information from the mirage of an infinite energy supply procured by a centralized power grid. By using solar energy to power the device, also including the web servers that host all the output data generated within the system, we align with the goal of moving towards non human interference practices.
